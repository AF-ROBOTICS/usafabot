    "In this lesson we will enable the robot to avoid obstacles. Many sensors provide obstacle avoidance capabilities: camera, sonar, infrared, LIDAR, etc. All of these will work to enable the robot to avoid obstacles, but we will use LIDAR as it is an affordable, but very capable solution."

    "[Slamtec's RPLIDAR A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1) is a 360 deg Laser Range Scanner. It is based on laser triangulation ranging principle and uses high-speed vision acquisition and processing hardware developed by Slamtec. It measures distance data in more than 8000 times per second. It has a detection range of 12 meters and an angular resolution of 1 degree. The distance resolution is 0.2 cm. It has a minimum detection rate of .15 meters.\n",
