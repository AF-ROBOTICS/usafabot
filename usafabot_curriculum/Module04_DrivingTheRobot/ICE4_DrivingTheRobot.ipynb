    "### Purpose\n",
    "This In-Class Exercise will introduce you to utilizing pre-built ROS packages to accomplish a task. It will also provide you experience interacting with someone else's source code (.py files) to learn how that component works. You will use ROS to run two nodes, **usafabot_serial** and **teleop_twist_keyboard**, to drive the USAFABOT with a keyboard. You will continue to practice using ROS tools to observe how these components communicate."

    "    There is a lot going on in this file. We will go over the important aspects in class, but you should understand that it creates a node called **usafabot_serial** which subscribes to the **/cmd_vel** topic and receives *Twist* messages (we only use the linear x and angular z characteristics). These values are then sent to the MSP_432 microcontroller over a serial connection (USB) to drive the robot accordingly. Simultaneously, the node receives wheel speeds from the robot and publishes the values over the **/wheel_speeds** topic.\n",
