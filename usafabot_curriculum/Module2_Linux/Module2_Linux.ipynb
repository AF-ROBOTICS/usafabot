    "This document is known as a Jupyter notebook; it is used in academia and industry to allow text and executable code to coexist in a very easy to read format. Blocks can contain text or code, and for blocks containing code, press `Shift + Enter` to run the code. Earlier blocks of code need to be run for the later blocks of code to work."

    "### Linux Commands\n",
    "During class we went over a number of basic Linux commands. Open a terminal on the Master and let's practice using those commands (use the shortcut `ctrl+alt+t` to open a new terminal window or select an open terminal and hit `ctrl+shift+t` to open a new terminal tab).\n",
    "\n",
    "When observing the terminal (or Shell) you will note the syntax `username@hostname:`(i.e., on the master: `dfec@masterX:`, on the robot: `pi@robotX`), the current working directory (i.e., `~`, which represents the home folder of the user), and lastly the '$' character and a blinking cursor. This line is the prompt and the blinking cursor indicates the terminal is active and ready for commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the command to make a new directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "`mkdir my_folder`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip:** In Linux, if you highlight a command you can paste it into the terminal by clicking the scroll wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change directories into your new folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd my_folder`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new script we can use to drive the robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "`touch move_usafabot.sh`\n",

    "We can use the Nano text editor to edit a file within the terminal. There are a number of text editors within the terminal and WWIII might be fought over which is best; some other options include Vim and Emacs. Nano is one of the more simple editors for quick edits. Feel free to use whichever works best for you, but all guidance within this course will be based on Nano.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bash script is a regular text file that allows you to run any command you would run within the terminal. We will use it to run a few ROS command line tools.\n",
