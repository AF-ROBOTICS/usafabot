    "This lab will provide practice in creating custom messages. You will take the **cmd_vel** topic and *Twist* message from the **teleop_twist_keyboard** node and use a **controller** node to send *USAFABOT_Cmd* messages to the **usafabot_serial** node. As we introduce new subsystems to the robot, the **controller** node will determine priority between these sensors/systems and then drive the robot using the **usafabot_cmd** topic accordingly."

On the **Robot**, the *USAFABOT_Cmd* message is part of the **usafabot** package. Therefore, the message must be part of the **usafabot** package on the **Master**. When communicating, ROS uses the **whole** name of the msg, *usafabot/USAFABOT_Cmd*, so these must be the same on each system. There should already be a **usafabot** package on your master.\n",
