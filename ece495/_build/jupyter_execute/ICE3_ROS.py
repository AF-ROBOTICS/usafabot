# # Module 3: Python3 for Robotics
# ## In-Class Exercise 3 - ROS
# Below you will run ROS commands. The "!" character in the front allows us to run bash commands from Jupyter and would **NOT** be used in the command line.
# 
# With the client and server nodes running execute the below commands.

# List all running nodes:

# In[1]:


get_ipython().system('')


# List the active topics:

# In[2]:


get_ipython().system('')


# Display running nodes and communication between them:

# In[3]:


get_ipython().system('')


# Exit the rqt_graph.
# 
# Show information about a the **/client** topic such as what type of messages are sent over the topic and publishing and subscribing nodes.

# In[4]:


get_ipython().system('')


# Display information about the message that is sent over the **/client** topic.

# In[5]:


get_ipython().system('')


# Display messages sent over the **/client** topic:

# In[6]:


get_ipython().system('')


# In the ICE3_Client notebook when you send a message you should see the message echoed above.
# 
# ### Checkpoint
# Once complete, get checked off by an instructor showing the output of each of the above.

# ## Cleanup
# In each of the notebooks reset the Jupter kernel and clear output. Close each notebook. Shutdown the notebook server by typing `ctrl+c` within the terminal you ran `jupyter-notebook` in. Select 'y'.
