    "## Purpose\n",
    "In practice, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) device provides orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. The [UM7 Orientation Sensor](https://www.pololu.com/product/2764) from Redshift Labs is an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) that contains a three-axis accelerometer, rate gyro, and magnetometer. Unlike a typical inertial measurement unit (IMU), which only provides raw sensor readings, the UM7 features an onboard microcontroller that combines sensor data using an EKF to generate orientation estimates 500 times a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "![IMU](Figures/IMU.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The UM7 Orientation Sensor is connected to the [Pololu USB AVR Programmer v2.1](https://www.pololu.com/product/3172), a compact, low-cost in-system programmer (ISP). The programmer provides an interface for communicating with the UM7 Orientation Sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IMU provides values that are part of the robot state and allow the robot to navigate more accurately. Combined with data from the tachometers these values provide the odometry of the robot to estimate change in position over time. We will primarily use the IMU to perform 90 and 180 degree turns.\n",

    "## Calibrate the UM7 Orientation Sensor\n",
    "As described above, there are a number of different sensors that work together to provide the attitude and heading estimates for the UM7 Orientation Sensor. These sensors are sensitive to magnetic fields which are unique to locale and device. As you will learn in future ECE classes, all electronic devices create small magnetic fields. Even electrons traveling over a wire create magnetic fields. The UM7 Orientation Sensor is strategically placed in the center of the robot for best attitude and heading performance, however, this location is also in the center of a number of magnetic fields. We can use [Redshift Lab's Serial Interface Software](https://redshiftlabs.com.au/support-services/serial-interface-software/) along with their [calibration procedure](https://redshiftlabs.com.au/support-services/um7-calibration-procedure/) to calibrate the UM7 to provide a more accurate attitude and heading reading.\n",
    "### Calibration Steps:\n",
    "1. Plug the Pololu USB AVR Programmer v2.1 into your computer. You may want to move the USB cable so it is easier to rotate the robot when calibrating (when looking at the USB cables connected to the robot, the top left should be connected to the programmer).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Launch Redshift Labs serial interface software by double clicking the icon on your desktop or finding it in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set COM Ports: You will need to configure which virtual COM port has been allocated to your USB serial converter PCB. Select **\"Serial Settings > Port > COMX\"** (where X is the allocated COM port number on your PC, in my case, it is the higher number). Select **Connect** and continue selecting ports until a value shows up under \"Sensor Firmware Version\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read Data: Select **‚ÄúConfiguration > Read‚Äù**. A progress bar should load and once it is finished the configuration data should be displayed. Press the + button next to **‚ÄúBroadcast Rates ‚Äì Raw Data‚Äù** now select **‚ÄúAll Raw Broadcast Rate‚Äù**, verify that it is set to 20 Hz. If not, type 20 into the corresponding text box and press **‚ÄúConfiguration > FLASH‚Äù**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. From the tabs select **\"Data\"**.\n",
    "    1. Click the + icon next to **\"Euler Angles\"**.\n",
    "    1. Tick **Roll**, **Pitch**, and **Yaw** checkboxes.\n",
    "    1. Press **\"Create Graph from Selected\"**.\n",
    "    1. A real time graph should be displayed in a separate window of Roll, Pitch, and Yaw. We suggest using your mouse to expand the window a little.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1.  Start Magnetometer Calibration: To begin magnetometer calibration select **‚ÄúMag Calibration > Start Data‚Äù** you should notice that the **‚ÄúCollected Data Points:‚Äù** begin counting up. While the software is taking samples, rotate your UM7-LT around in a spherical position capturing as many different samples of the surrounding magnetic field as possible. Keep well away from anything that will produce magnetic distortions in your sample set, i.e. ferrous metal or powerful magnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stop Collecting Data: When you see that the **‚ÄúCollected Data Points:‚Äù** number turn green, that‚Äôs an indication that you have collected the minimum samples required to perform a calibration. I usually collect about 500 samples. Now select **\"Mag Calibration > Stop Data‚Äù**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute Biases: You are now ready to compute the biases for calibration, select **‚ÄúMag Calibration > Compute‚Äù**. You should now see some computed data in the **‚ÄúCalibration Matrix‚Äù**. Select **‚ÄúMag Calibration > Write to RAM‚Äù**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write Calibration Data: You will want your calibration data to persist, so now select **‚ÄúConfiguration > FLASH‚Äù**. This will write the calibration data into your UM7-LT, the calibration matrix will be stored even if the power is turned off and back on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Zero Rate Gyros: This is needed in the later sets of firmware. It will initialize your new calibration correctly. Select **‚ÄúCommands > Zero Rate Gyros‚Äù**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set Magnetic Reference Vector: Point your UM7-LT exactly North (North on the UM7 is left of front on the robot), now press **‚ÄúCommands > Set Mag Reference Vector‚Äù**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reset EKF: You will now need to reset the EKF for the process to work correctly. You may notice that the graphs on your data plot are displaying incorrectly. Select **‚ÄúCommands > Reset EKF‚Äù**. Now look at the data plot of Roll, Pitch and Yaw. If you point the X orientation of the sensor North and hold the unit as level as possible, you should see the Roll, Pitch and Yaw converge to zero."
