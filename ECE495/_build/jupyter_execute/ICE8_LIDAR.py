# # Module 8: LIDAR
# ## In-Class Exercise 8
# ---

# ### Purpose
# In this lesson we will enable the robot to avoid obstacles. Many sensors provide obstacle avoidance capabilities: camera, sonar, infrared, LIDAR, etc. All of these will work to enable the robot to avoid obstacles, but we will use LIDAR as it is an affordable, but very capable solution.

# ### LIDAR
# [Slamtec's RPLIDAR A1](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1) is a 360 deg Laser Range Scanner. It is based on laser triangulation ranging principle and uses high-speed vision acquisition and processing hardware developed by Slamtec. It measures distance data in more than 8000 times per second. It has a detection range of 12 meters and an angular resolution of 1 degree. The distance resolution is 0.2 cm. It has a minimum detection rate of .15 meters.

# ### Setup
# The [RPLIDAR ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/rplidar) package is pre-installed on your **Master** and **Robot**. But as always, trust, but verify. Open a new terminal on your **Master** and run the following:
# 
# ```bash
# rospack find rplidar_ros
# ```
# 
# If installed, the command should return the absolute path to the package, similar to:
# 
# ```bash
# /home/pi/master_ws/src/rplidar_ros
# ```
# 
# If the command instead returns an error, then you need to install the package. This package has not been compiled for ROS Noetic, so you must download the source code into the workspace source folder. When you install a ROS package from source, you have to manually download any dependencies (using rosdep) and then compile it.
# 
# ```bash
# cd ~/master_ws/src
# git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/um7.git
# cd ~/master_ws
# rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
# catkin_make
# source ~/.bashrc
# ```
# 
# Create an ssh connection to your **Robot** and repeat the above.

# ### Testing LIDAR
# Open a new terminal on the master and run roscore and setup for statistics:
# 
# ```bash
# roscore
# rosparam set enable_statistics true
# ```
# 
# Select the terminal with the secure shell connection to your **Robot** and open the `robotics.launch` file. The launch file already calls the `rplidar.launch` file, so uncomment the last line in the launch file (remove `<!--` and `-->`above the following so it looks like:
# 
# ```xml
# <!-- call the rplidar launch file -->
# <include file="$(find usafabot)/launch/include/rplidar.launch"/>
# ```
# 
# > üìùÔ∏è **Note:** The `robotics.launch` file also gives us some additional visualization capabilities (remember the Unified Robot Description Format (urdf) file at the top of the launch file? This will provide us a cool USAFABot model in our simulation!)
# 
# Run the launch file on the **Robot**:
# 
# ```bash
# roslaunch usafabot robotics.launch
# ```
# 
# In a new terminal on teh **Master**, run rviz:
# 
# ```bash
# rosrun rviz rviz
# ```
# 
# This should open a window that we can use to visualize ROS components of our system.
# 
# Select the drop down under "Global Options" ‚Üí "Fixed Frame" and ensure "map" is selected.
# 
# <img src="Figures/map.png" width="400" height="195.89">
# 
# Below the "Displays" panel select "Add".
# 
# <img src="Figures/add.PNG" width="300" height="95.89">
# 
# Select "RobotModel" and click "OK".
# 
# <img src="Figures/robotmodel.png" width="300" height="95.89">
# 
# You should now see a model of the USAFABot in the center of your **rviz** map.
# 
# Below the "Displays" panel select "Add".
# 
# Select "LaserScan" and click "OK".
# 
# <img src="Figures/laserscan.png" width="300" height="95.89">
# 
# You should now see a "LaserScan" drop down under the "Displays" panel. Expand it.
# 
# Click the empty space to the right of "Topic" and select the "/scan" topic.
# 
# <img src="Figures/scan.png" width="300" height="95.89">
# 
# You should now see red dots fill the **rviz** map where obstacles exist. You can increase the size of these using the "Size (m)" setting within the "LaserScan" panel.
# 
# In a new terminal on the **Master**, run the **rplidar Node Client** toold provided by the **rplidar** ROS package:
# 
# ```bash
# rosrun rplidar_ros rplidarNodeClient
# ```
# 
# This should provide distance data from objects at specific angle increments. If we kill the **rplidarNodeClient** node, we can investigate what information the **rplidar_ros** launch file is sending.
# 
# Type the following and observe the command output:
# 
# ```bash
# rostopic list
# rostopic info /scan
# rostopic type /scan
# rostopic type /scan | rosmsg show
# rostopic echo /scan
# ```
# 
# At this point you can kill all nodes on the master, but keep the **rplidar_ros** launch file running on the **Robot**.

# ### LIDAR Subscriber
# In this section we will build a subscriber that will print the range data from the RPLIDAR A1 Range Scanner.
# 
# 1. Browse to a terminal on the **Master** and create an `ice8` package:
#     ```bash
#     cd ~/master_ws/src/ece495_master_spring2022-USERNAME/
#     catkin_create_pkg ice8 rospy sensor_msgs rplidar_ros geometry_msgs
#     cd ~/master_ws
#     catkin_make
#     source ~/.bashrc
#     ```
# 
# 1. Create an lidar node:
# 
#     ```bash
#     roscd ice8/src
#     touch lidar_sub.py
#     ```
#     
# 1. Copy and complete the below code using the GUI editor tool, **Thonny**. Browse to the subscriber you just created and double-click. This will open the file in **Thonny** (if it is open in any other editor, stop, raise your hand, and get help from an instructor)
# > üí°Ô∏è **Tip**: Look for the **"TODO"** tag which indicates where you should insert your own code.
# 
# The code should obtain the list of range data from the LIDAR launch file running on the robot, convert the angles from 0 to 180 degrees and 0 to -180 degrees to 0 to 360 degrees. Lastly, the subscriber will print the average distance of obstacles 30 degrees off the nose of the robot.

# ```python
# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# import rospy, math
# # TODO: import correct message
# 
# # lambda function to convert rad to deg
# RAD2DEG = lambda x: ((x)*180./math.pi)
# # convert LaserScan degree from -180 - 180 degs to 0 - 360 degs
# DEG_CONV = lambda deg: deg + 360 if deg < 0 else deg
# 
# class LIDAR:    
#     """Class to read lidar data from RPLidar A1 using the rplidar_ros pkg"""
#     def __init__(self):
#         # TODO: create a subscriber to the scan topic published by the rplidar launch file
# 
#         
#         self.ctrl_c = False
#         rospy.on_shutdown(self.shutdownhook)
#         
#     def callback_lidar(self, scan):
#     	if not self.ctrl_c:
# 	    	degrees = []
# 	    	ranges = []
# 	    	
# 	    	# determine how many scans were taken during rotation
# 	        count = int(scan.scan_time / scan.time_increment)
# 	        
# 	        for i in range(count):
# 	            # using min angle and incr data determine curr angle, 
# 	            # convert to degrees, convert to 360 scale
# 	            degrees.append(int(DEG_CONV(RAD2DEG(scan.angle_min + scan.angle_increment*i))))
# 	            rng = scan.ranges[i]
# 	            
# 	            # ensure range values are valid; set to 0 if not
# 	            if rng < scan.range_min or rng > scan.range_max:
# 	                ranges.append(0.0)
# 	            else:
# 	            	ranges.append(rng)
# 	        
# 	        # python way to iterate two lists at once!
# 	        for deg, rng in zip(degrees, ranges):
# 	        	# TODO: sum and count the ranges 30 degrees off the nose of the robot
#                 
#             # TODO: ensure you don't divide by 0 and print average off the nose
# 	        	
# 	def shutdownhook(self):
# 		print("Shutting down lidar subscriber")
# 		self.ctrl_c = True
#         
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     rospy.init_node('lidar_sub')
#     LIDAR()
#     rospy.spin()
# ```

# 4. Save, exit, and make the node executable.
# 
# 4. Open a new terminal on the **Master** and run the **lidar_sub.py** node.
# 
# 4. Rotate the **Robot** and observe the distance off the nose.

# ### Checkpoint
# Once complete, get checked off by an instructor showing the output of your **lidar_sub** and **rqt_graph** node.

# ## Summary
# In this lesson you learned how to integrate the LIDAR and get the distance of objects off the nose of the robot using the pre-built **rplidar** ROS package. In the lab that corresponds to this lesson you will apply this knowledge to stop the robot a specified distance from an obstacle and turn.

# ## Cleanup
# In each terminal window, close the node by typing `ctrl+c`. Exit any SSH connections. Shutdown the notebook server by typing `ctrl+c` within the terminal you ran `jupyter-notebook` in. Select 'y'.
# 
# **Ensure roscore is terminated before moving on to the lab.**
