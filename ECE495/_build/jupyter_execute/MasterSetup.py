# # Master Setup
# This guide will walk through the steps to install Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS, ROS Noetic, and all dependencies on a desktop computer. This computer system is utilized in the United States Air Force Academy's Electrical and Computer Engineering department in an embedded network with the ground robot, USAFABot. The master system is used to host *roscore*, utilize ROS GUI tools, and create secure connections with the USAFABot.
# 
# ---

# ## Hardware
# For our application, we are using [Intel NUC Kits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc/kits.html) but these instructions will work on any AMD64 architecture. 

# ## Software
# ### Download Ubuntu and flash USB
# For the desktop machine you will first need to download [Ubuntu Desktop 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/). 
# 
# Once download, follow the instructions to create a [bootable Ubuntu USB stick](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview) within Ubuntu. The guide provides links to create USB sticks from Windows and macOS as well.
# 
# Once the bootable USB stick is created, follow the guide to [Install Ubuntu desktop](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview) selecting a useful computer name such as `master0`. The NUC requires you to press and hold F10 on startup to boot from a USB stick.

# #### Setup GitHub SSH Keys
# The following assumes you already have a GitHub account.
# 
# Create SSH keys to use with your GitHub account by typing the following using the same email as you GitHub login:
# 
# ```bash
# cd
# ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github@email.com"
# ```
# 
# When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", hit **enter**.
# 
# At the prompt, type a secure password.
# 
# Start the ssh-agent in the background and add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
# 
# ```bash
# eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
# ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# ```
# 
# Open the public key with your favorite command line editor (this is easier to accomplish via an SSH connection from a desktop machine with a GUI so you can copy the public key to your GitHub account).
# 
# ```bash
# nano ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# ```
# 
# Copy the contents of the file (maximize the window and ensure you copy the entire contents up to the GitHub email).
# 
# Open a web browser and sign in to your GitHub account.
# 
# In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**:
# 
# <img src="Figures/ssh1.png" width="200" height="300">
# 
# In the user settings sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**:
# 
# <img src="Figures/ssh2.png" width="200" height="300">
# 
# Click **New SSH key**:
# 
# <img src="Figures/ssh3.png" width="600" height="400">
# 
# In the "Title" field, add a descriptive label for the new key, such as "master0".
# 
# Paste your key into the "Key" field (contents of the `.pub` file).
# 
# Click **Add SSH key**.

# #### Update Alternatives
# Python3 is installed in Ubuntu20 by default. Some ROS packages utilize the "python" command instead of "python3" so we need to create a new executable, "/usr/bin/python" that will call the Python3 (basically use the command "python" to call Python3):
# 
# ```bash
# sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 10
# ```
# 
# #### Additional Software
# 
# ```
# sudo apt install jupyter-notebook
# ```

# ### ROS Noetic
# At this point, the Ubuntu environment is setup. Now we will setup the ROS requirements for the master. All of these instructions are adapted from the [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu). ROS Noetic is the latest version of ROS 1 that supports Ubuntu Focal.
# 
# #### Installation
# Accept software from packages.ros.org:
# 
# ```bash
# sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
# ```
# 
# Set up keys:
# 
# ```bash
# sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
# curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
# ```
# 
# Install ROS Noetic:
# 
# ```bash
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt -y install ros-noetic-desktop-full
# ```
# 
# The full version provides theminimum packaging, build, communications libraries, GUI tools, and 2D/3D simulation and perception packages.
# 
# Install ROS dependencies for building packages:
# 
# ```bash
# sudo apt -y install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool python3-pip xterm build-essential
# ```
# 
# Initialize rosdep
# 
# ```bash
# sudo rosdep init
# rosdep update
# ```
# 
# Source the ROS setup file:
# ```bash
# source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
# ```
# 
# Create your ROS workspace:
# 
# ```bash
# mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
# cd ~/catkin_ws/
# catkin_make
# ```
# 
# Setup ROS environment variables and setup scripts within the `~/.bashrc` file. Open the `~/.bashrc` file with your favorite command line editor and add the following to the bottom:
# 
# ```bash
# source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
# source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
# export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src:/opt/ros/noetic/share
# export ROS_HOSTNAME=`hostname` # note these are backticks, not apostrophes
# export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://MASTER_IP:11311 # replace "MASTER_IP" with IP address/hostname of your master
# ```
# 
# Any time you make changes to your `~/.bashrc` file you must source it:
# 
# ```bash
# source ~/.bashrc
# ```
# 
# #### Dependencies
# There are a number of ROS packages required to operate the USAFABot. To ensure ROS message compatibility you will want all of these libraries to be downloaded on your desktop as well. Some of these can be installed using `apt install` and others have to be installed from source. Change directories to your source folder and follow the below steps to install each dependency.
# 
# ```bash
# cd ~/catkin_ws/src
# ```
# 
# ##### [RPLIDAR](http://wiki.ros.org/rplidar)
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros
# ```
# 
# ##### [Serial](http://wjwwood.io/serial/)
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/wjwwood/serial
# ```
# 
# ##### [UM7](http://wiki.ros.org/um7)
# ```bash
# git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/um7
# ```
# 
# ##### [USAFABot](https://github.com/AF-ROBOTICS/usafabot)
# ```bash
# git clone git@github.com:AF-ROBOTICS/usafabot.git
# ```
# 
# The **usafabot_curriculum** package includes all dependencies needed to run the USAFABot nodes. We can automatically install these dependencies using the ROSDEP tool:
# 
# ```bash
# cd ~/catkin_ws
# rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
# ```
# 
# This will take a while.
# 
# Now we can make and source our workspace:
# 
# ```bash
# cd ~/catkin_ws
# catkin_make
# source ~/.bashrc
# ```
# 
# The last set of dependencies we need to install are Python dependencies. These are listed within our **usafabot_curriculum** package and can be installed using the `pip3` tool:
# 
# ```bash
# roscd usafabot_curriculum
# pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# ```
# 
# > üìùÔ∏è **Note:** the "dlib" package will take quite a while to install.
