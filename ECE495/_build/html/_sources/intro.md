# Getting Started


## 1. Cloning the GitHub Repository

You will need to download the entire GitHub repository for this class.

**Using Git**

In your terminal, create a new folder on your desktop:

`cd Desktop`

`mkdir ECE495`

Navigate to the new file you just created. We will be using this to hold all the 495 files you'll need for class.

`cd ECE495`

Now dowlnoad the files from GitHub with the command:

`https://github.com/AF-ROBOTICS/usafabot/tree/master/ECE495`

Once the download completes, change your directory to 'ECE495' (for example, using the command `cd ECE495`).


## 4. Opening Jupyter Notebook

To install Jupyter Notebook, open a new terminal and use the command:

`pip3 install jupyter`

Once you've completed all of the steps above, you should be able to run Jupyter Notebook.

To test it out, open a new terminal and navigate to the ECE495 folder: 

`cd Desktop/ECE495`

We will now open the Jupyter Notebook. In Jupyter Notebook, you will be able to edit the ECE495 files on your local computer. Be careful however, we will need these files for class. To open Jupyter Notebook. Run the command:

`jupyter notebook`


## 5. Opening the Class Website

Once you've completed all of the steps above, you should be able to open the [class website](file:///home/dfec/Desktop/ECE495/_build/html/intro.html) powered by Jupyter Notebook.
